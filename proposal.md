# Project Proposal 

## Description
I have decided to make a puzzle sliding game for my major project. I made a sinple version of one puzzle for my 2d arrays assignment. To build on top of it, I am going to add more features to my game. 

## Need to Have List

- two puzzle options of different dificulty level (easy and hard mode)
    - be able to shuffle the images
    - be able to click on each image and check if it should move or not
- a buttton to look at the final image in the middle of the game
- a title screen to give instructions 
- an end screen for when the puzzle is completed
- a counter to count the number of moves taken
- a timer to time the amount of time taken to complete the puzzle

## Nice to Have List

- center the grids 
- sound effects
- nice looking backgrounds
- a give up option to skip to end screen
- be able to choose the images for the puzzle  out of a selection of images
- scale to page
